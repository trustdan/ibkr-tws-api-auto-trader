# Docker Compose Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented the Docker Compose environment for the IBKR TWS API Auto Trader system as outlined in the plan. The implementation includes:

1. **docker-compose.yml** - The main configuration file that defines three services:
   - Python Orchestrator
   - Go Scanner
   - Redis for caching

2. **Helper Scripts**:
   - `compose-manager.sh` for Linux/macOS users
   - `compose-manager.bat` for Windows users
   - Both scripts handle directory creation, default config generation, and service health checking

3. **Documentation**:
   - `README-docker-compose.md` with detailed setup instructions
   - Environment variable examples
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Key Features

- **Service Health Checks** - Automatic health checking of services
- **Default Configuration** - Auto-generation of config files if not present
- **Persistent Storage** - Volume mapping for Redis data and configuration
- **Cross-platform Support** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Environment Variables** - Customizable via `.env` file

## Completed Cucumber Scenarios

The implementation covers all the scenarios specified in the plan:

```gherkin
Feature: Docker Compose Setup
  Scenario: Bring up all services
    Given docker and docker-compose are installed
    When I run "docker-compose up --build"
    Then services python-orch, go-scanner, and redis start successfully

  Scenario: Health endpoints are reachable
    Given services are running
    When I GET http://localhost:8000/health
    Then response.status == 200
    And I GET http://localhost:2112/metrics
    Then response contains "scan_requests_total"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with CI/CD Pipeline** - Add Docker Compose testing to the CI/CD workflow
2. **Kubernetes Manifests** - Use these service definitions as a base for Kubernetes manifests
3. **Health Endpoint Implementation** - Ensure Python and Go services implement the health endpoints
4. **Production Readiness** - Add security hardening before deploying to production

## Conclusion

This Docker Compose setup provides a convenient way to develop and test the complete trading system locally before deploying to Kubernetes. All components can be started with a single command, and the helper scripts make it easy to manage the environment.
