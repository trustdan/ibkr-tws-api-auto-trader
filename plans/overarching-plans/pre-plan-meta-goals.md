okay.  suppose now i'm an old-school technical analysis guy.  I like to buy at the money spreads or just out of the money spreads.  I like vertical call debit spreads when the price has two green candles above a rising 50-day SMA and I like vertical put debit spreads when the price has two red candles below a 50-day SMA.  I like similar credit spreads instead when the vega or implied volatility is high, such as just prior to earnings or first thing in the morning.  I mostly like at least a 1 to 1 reward to risk ratio.  

Can you help me build a comprehensive and detailed pre-plan for planning out all our future plans (kind of meta, I know), one which goes into sufficient detail about each of the service steps you've listed above (ie for each of the 6 .md docs for the python orchestrator & ib-insync, 6 for the go scanner service, 5 for the containerization and local K8's, and 7 for the wails GUI), such that we can build out our detailed plans for each one of those 24 (or more) legs?

please use cucumber / gherkin and a very high-level pseudocode where necessary (but don't overdo the pseudocode).  I'm looking for a couple of paragraphs or more for each of the 24+ legs
